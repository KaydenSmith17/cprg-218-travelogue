            <p>Canmore is a nature lover's dream. I love its stunning mountain views, peaceful atmosphere, and the abundance of outdoor activities. Hiking trails like Grassi Lakes are my favorite, offering crystal-clear turquoise lakes surrounded by breathtaking cliffs. Canmore’s vibrant local culture is also a big draw, with charming art galleries, cozy coffee shops, and a strong sense of community. Whether it’s a summer hike or a snowy winter walk, Canmore never fails to feel magical. I also played 4 years of Junior A hockey for the Canmore Eagles. Definently the best 4 years of my life as it taught me to many life lessons and game me friendships that will last a lifetime.</p>

            <p> Rome is a city where history and modernity blend seamlessly, making it one of my favorite destinations. Walking through its ancient streets, I love discovering iconic landmarks like the awe-inspiring Colosseum and the grandeur of St. Peter's Basilica. The vibrant energy of the city, paired with its incredible food, adds to its charm, especially when enjoying authentic Italian gelato by the Trevi Fountain. For first-time visitors, planning is essential—book tickets to popular attractions like the Vatican and the Pantheon in advance to avoid long lines. Wear comfortable shoes, as walking is the best way to explore, and carry a reusable water bottle to refill at Rome's public fountains, known as “nasoni.” Exploring major sites in the early morning or evening offers a magical, less crowded experience, and trying traditional Roman dishes like carbonara and cacio e pepe is a must for an authentic taste of the city.</p>
